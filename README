BUGS
----

If I run the program with the ext2_image, something causes the program to get stuck in an infinite loop. I isolated the bug to the DIRENT code and specifically, the while loop that checks if (l < block_size) where l is the byte offset into the block. I'm still not sure entirely why this is occuring and the time for submission is approaching so I am not able to turn in a completely robust program for this assignment. 

UPDATE: Never mind!!! After spending what seems like forever typing 'gdb lab3a' and making some adjustments to my lab3a.c, the program has stopped infini-looping. 

It seemed the problem was I completely ignored the fact that some nodes have data blocks stored indirectly so I added a get_indirects() function that obtains all remote data blocks and scans those for directory entries and now it's working huzzah!! 

How corect those entries are - now that's for you to decide.
